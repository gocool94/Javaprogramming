//Problem Statement

Write a class with the name Wall. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width and height of type double. [DONE]

The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg constructor). [DONE]

The second constructor has parameters width and height of type double and it needs to initialize the fields. [DONE]

In case the width is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, [DONE]
in case the height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.[DONE]

Write the following methods (instance methods):

* Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field. [DONE]

* Method named getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field. [DONE]

* Method named setWidth with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the width field.
If the parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0. [DONE]

* Method named setHeight with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the height field.
If the parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0. [DONE]

* Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the area of the wall. [DONE]
